Here's the evidence: We plotted the launch versus no-launch distribution for days that the Wind Speed at Launch Time <= 1 prior to dropping the column earlier in this notebook and it shows that for nearly all times we don’t launch:"

If the wind speed was less than 1.0, then 191 of the 240 samples were correctly guessed to be no launch. We see that 191 of those samples only needed the Wind Speed at Launch Time value to be less than 1.0 to correctly guess the outcome, while above 1.0 required more information.\n",

    "This insight isn't good. We previously set all values that were empty to 0. We also know that many of the values that were related to the time of launch were 0 because 60% of our data wasn't related to an actual launch or attempted launch.\n",

Here, you can see that of the remaining 49 days when the max wind speed was less than 30.5, 48 of the days yielded a correct launch output and one of them yielded a no-launch output.\n",
